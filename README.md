# tson
Type Safe Object Notation

``tson`` (read Tyson) is a comprehensive, json like format, that supports out of the box:

* byte, short, int, long and bigint types
* float, double, bigdecimal types
* arrays, objects (maps)
* complex, matrices


# Rational
Why not JSON. Well json does not support type safe primitives and is very limited
Why not YAML. YAML is error-prone
